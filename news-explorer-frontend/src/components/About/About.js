                    <p className='about__description'>Welcome to the final project of DesireeÂ´Joy Bradish, Software Developer. This was created for the Practicum by Yandex Full Stack bootcamp. This project has a custom build API that is hosted on a localhost on a Netlify site. The front end is also hosted on the same site. A reverse proxy setup with Nginx and secured with Certbot controls the traffic allowing the front and back ends to communicate. This project also utilizes a news API service that users can query and then save those articles to their own account.</p>
